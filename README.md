# Wealth Management Model – Demo Version:
This repository contains the demonstration version of my Wealth Management Model on excel.
It’s designed as a template that anyone can download, explore, and customize for their own personal financial planning.

There is no real personal financial data in the files. All numbers are used as example values.
